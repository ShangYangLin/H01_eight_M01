Using artificial intelligence and medical health big data to reverse the medical care and management of chronic diseases project (NSTC 110－2634－F－002－049), sub-plan8, model1

These models were built by Shang-Yang Lin (Research Center of Sleep Medicine, TAIPEI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY)

Background: Sleep apnea was highly associated with metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative disease, which cause heavy burden of medical system.  

Objective: Built AI model of metabolic disorders and neurodegeneration in patients with sleep apnea (biochemical indicators) helps physicians and clinical health care personnels in early identify high risk population.

Methods: Use the anthropometric features, medical and mental illness history, polysonmographic indexes, questionnaires (anxiety, depression, sleepness, etc.), metabolic and biochemical indicators (blood glucose monitoring, inflammatory biochemical indicators, blood lipid content, etc.), neurocognitive biochemical indicators (amyloid and Tau protein detection) to built risk of cognitive function alarm model.

Results: Since August 2020, we have included subjects who are willing to participate in the study. However, due to the COVID19 epidemic, the progress of case acceptance is not as expected, so it is hard to improve the accuracy currently.

Keywords: cognitive function, Alzheimer's disease, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE)
